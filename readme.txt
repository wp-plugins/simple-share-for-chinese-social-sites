Simplified version of Sinoshare plugin with 40 sharing options. Increase social networking with your Chinese audience.

== Description ==

This is a simplified version of the Sinoshare plugin with 40 sharing options. I have converted the plugin so it runs as jQuery instead of Prototype. After installation, you will see a 分享此文章 at the end of the content. Next version will include a shortcode and more configuration options.
Support is provided at [my blog](http://blog.centilin.com/). You can also view plugin info and download it at the [plugin page](http://blog.centilin.com/everything_it/web-design/wordpress/simple-share-for-chinese-social-sites/ "Simple Share For Chinese Social Sites")
